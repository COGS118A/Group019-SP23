    "This project aims to train a classifier to help doctors determine if a patient has the indicators for heart disease and allow the doctors to move forward and run more tests bloodworks etc. We will be using data form a telephone survey that the CDC collects annually. This data is form their 2015 survey. We will be classifying this data to determine whether the patient has heart disease or not. We will use a decision tree classifier to do this. In this project, we will be selecting features for the decision tree first then tuning hyperparameters of the decision tree. We will use confusion matrix to determine the performance of the model. \n"

Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
